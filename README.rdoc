This is Pinksalt, my first independently-built Rails app. Pinksalt was a simple HTML generator for fashion label The Whitepepper, built in an attempt to thwart the Shopify text editor which is difficult to work with for staff who aren't familiar with HTML. 

Parameters are entered into the forms and, when submitted, generate a raw HTML template which can be pasted into the HTML editor in sections. The user is led to generate the appropriate sizing table by clicking through a flowchart interface. Very, very low-tech. 

I am very aware that the code in this is pretty shocking; I do intend to go back and establish the best-practice methods of accomplishing this (an alternative to conditional logic in views, and ditching scaffolding would be nice for starters) - this was more an experiment than anything else as I wanted to see how quickly I could get a working app off the ground with virtually no experience in Rails.
